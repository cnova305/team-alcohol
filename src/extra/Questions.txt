Question 1.5.2

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 
It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
It represents a webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to work through the document. 
With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate elements of HTML

By using virtual DOM, we can find out what is changed and with that, we can apply only those changes to real DOM instead of replacing entire DOM.

Question 1.5.3

Server-side rendering is the most common method for displaying information onto the screen. 
It works by converting HTML files in the server into usable information for the browser.

Advantages:

>Faster page loads
>Better performance 
>Easy indexation by search engines
>Better in terms of accessibility

Disadvantages:

>Costly
>Compatibility Issues
>Slow page rendering

Question 1.5.4

JSX stands for Javascript XML and it is a very useful tool for development in React. It is an extension of the JavaScript language which gives us 
the ability to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in the DOM by converting the HTML tags into React elements without the need for other 
methods like createElement() or appendChild().

JSX is interpreted by browser JavaScript engines by way of transpilation.JSX code is transformed into standard JavaScript using a tool like Babel 
before it's served to the browser. Babel is a popular transpiler that can convert JSX into plain JavaScript. 
This step usually takes place during the build process of a web application.
